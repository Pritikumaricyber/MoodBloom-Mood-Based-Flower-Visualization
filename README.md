# MoodBloom-Mood-Based-Flower-Visualization
MoodBloom is a JavaFX-based desktop application that lets users select a mood and see a uniquely coded flower bloom on screen, styled to visually reflect that emotion. Each mood is mapped to a custom flower with a specific shape, color, and layout. User mood selections are also saved to a MySQL database for mood history tracking.
